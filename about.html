            <p>I like to represent the Bees, as I have two Big Ones in my name! 
            My handle on just about every profile is even Bee4Brendan.
            It's not just Bees that are important to me though, I find solace in 
            all of the nature around me! </p>
            <p>The colors, shapes, and sounds around the world inspire me to 
            create stunning designs. </p>
            <p>Bees are also good role models for society or just in general. 
            They represent teamwork, focus, and generosity, which all happen
            to Bee a crucial part of Software Development and its lifecycle. Their 
            selflessness in sacrificing for the betterment of the colony is always 
            admirable to me! </p>
